# Project Summary

In this project, we'll provide two JavaScript applications to help improve your skills. There are no dependencies for this project; they are designed to demonstrate how to write applications with just the structures provided by the language.

## Setup

* `Fork` this repository.
* `Clone` your fork.
* Select a project you would like to begin with and navigate into that directory.
    * For the best experience, the projects should be done in the following order
        * vanilla-mouse-party
        * vanilla-piano
    * There is an optional third project, vanilla-typeahead, that adds in new technologies that can be done as a Black Diamond project.
* Open the `index.html` file in your browser using either `live-server` or simply opening the file.
    * If you want to use `live-server`, run `npm i -g live-server` and run it in the command line within the project folder.
* Complete each project according to its associated `README` and move on to the next.
